part one:
        in main while loop:
                read command
                create process with fork()
                        if command is valid (do this by checking if command is a %PATH variable)
                                execute command
                        if command is 'quit'/'exit' or something similar
                                join main process
                                break main loop
        
part two:
        in main while loop:
                read command
                create thread
                        if command is valid
                                execute command
                join thread and get return value
                if command is 'quit'/'exit' or something similar
